## What Even Is This?

RubyConf Colombia is our second not-for-profit, community-driven Ruby,
         Rails and related technologies conference in Medellin,
         Colombia. RubyConf is a two-day conference (2th-3th September
             2016) with a lot of awesome speakers from around the world
         and locally.
         The projected attendee number for RubyConf Colombia 2016 is
         around 250.

## Main goals of the event

         Building on 2015's success, the organizers of RubyConf Colombia
         2016 aim to make this year's event more impactful and with
         greater international exposure. The three goals of the
         conference are: (1) Share knowledge across borders and
         languages, (2) Expose the local community to bleeding edge
         tools and techniques in Ruby and software engineering, and (3)
  Highlight the work and effort of local community members. RubyConf
  Colombia is the premier space to connect with international and local
  leaders in all things related to Ruby.

## More to Come

  We'll be sending out information announcing early bird tickets, our
  call for proposals, our master/mistress of ceremonies, and confirmed
  speakers to the [mailing list](rubyconf.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=7b7c2e5ead7427750ced71f09&amp;id=22ba1d80e6). The [mailing list](rubyconf.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=7b7c2e5ead7427750ced71f09&amp;id=22ba1d80e6) is going to
